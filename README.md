# doersino.github.io

I've got a bunch of projects hosted on GitHub Pages, so it'd be kinda weird if the *index* of that subdomain pointed nowhere. Hence, a redirect to my website!

[noahdoersing.com](https://noahdoersing.com)

(Note that I followed [this set of instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68505452/github-pages-with-single-custom-subdomain-for-multiple-repositories-using-paths) to make `doersino.github.io/*` available under `ghpages.noahdoersing.com/*`, hence the `CNAME` file.)
